# Learning C#

In this repository, I will create some small programs to learn C#.
My goal is to understand the syntax and features of the language so I can develop my own game.

#1 project is a Task Manager, where I use structures like for, if, and switch, and explore some language details. ✔️

#2 project is a turn based combat. In this project, I will create a turn-based combat system where the hero and the villain face off against each other. The goal is to test classes, objects, properties, methods, lists, control structures, and encapsulation.
