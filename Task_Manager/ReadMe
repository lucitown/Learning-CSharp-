## Task Manager - C# Learning Project
A console-based task manager developed in C# as part of learning fundamental programming concepts

## About This Project
This project implements a simple task management system that demonstrates core C# programming principles. It was created to explore object-oriented programming, file handling, and the basic structure of a console application.

## Key Features
  1. Task Management - Add, list, complete, and remove tasks
  2. Task Filtering - View pending and completed tasks separately
  3. Data Persistence - Automatic save/load using JSON files
  4. Timestamps - Track task creation and completion dates
  5. Simple Interface - Console-based interactive menu

## C# Concepts Demonstrated
  1. Object-Oriented Programming - Classes, Properties, Encapsulation
  2. Collections - List<T>, LINQ methods
  3. File I/O Operations - Reading/Writing JSON files
  4. Control Flow - Loops, Conditionals, Switch Statements
  5. Data Serialization - JSON via System.Text.Json
  6. Nullable Types - Using DateTime? for optional dates
  7. String Formatting - DateTime formatting, string interpolation
  8. Exception Handling - Basic input validation and error control

## Learning Focus
  1. This project is part of my ongoing process of mastering C# fundamentals, focusing on:
  2. Class Design - Creating simple data models
  3. Collection Management - Using List<T> with LINQ
  4. Data Persistence - JSON serialization/deserialization
  5. Console Applications - Building interactive menus
  6. File Operations - Reading and writing to filesystem

Language: C#
Framework: .NET 8.0
