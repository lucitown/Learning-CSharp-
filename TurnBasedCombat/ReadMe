## Turn-Based RPG Battle System
A turn-based battle system developed in C# as part of learning object-oriented programming and game development.

## About the Project
This project implements a turn-based combat system where players can create characters and battle against various types of enemies. Developed to demonstrate fundamental C# concepts and game programming principles.

## Key Features
  1. Turn-based combat system
  2. Enemy pool with different attributes
  3. Multiple actions (Attack, Defend)
  4. Basic AI for enemies
  5. Interactive console interface

## C# Concepts used
  1. Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Objects, Encapsulation)
  2. Control Flow (Loops, Conditionals, Switch Statements)
  3. Collections (List<T>, Arrays)
  4. Static Methods vs Instance Methods
  5. Access Modifiers (public, private, static)
  6. Nullable Reference Types
  7. String Interpolation
  8. Random Number Generation
  9. Console I/O Operations

## Learning Focus
  1. Game State Management - Tracking battle progress and turns
  2. Combat Systems - Implementing basic turn battle mechanics
  3. AI Behavior - Creating simple enemy decision logic
  4. Class Design - Structuring game entities and their interactions

Language: C#
