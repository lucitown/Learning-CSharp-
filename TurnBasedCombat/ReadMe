Turn-Based RPG Battle System
A turn-based battle system developed in CSharp as part of learning object-oriented programming and game development.

About the Project
This project implements a turn-based combat system where players can create characters and battle against various types of enemies. Developed to demonstrate fundamental CSharp concepts and game programming principles.

Key Features:
  1.  Turn-based combat system
  2. Enemy pool with different attributes
  3. Multiple actions (Attack, Defend)
  4. Basic AI for enemies
  5. Interactive console interface

CSharp Concepts used:
  1. Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Objects, Encapsulation)
  2. Control Flow (Loops, Conditionals, Switch Statements)
  3. Collections (List<T>, Arrays)
  4. Static Methods vs Instance Methods
  5. Access Modifiers (public, private, static)
  6. Nullable Reference Types
  7. String Interpolation
  8. Random Number Generation
  9. Console I/O Operations
